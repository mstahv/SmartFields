SMART FIELDS ADDON

This add-on tries extend the DefaultFieldFactor in core Vaadin so 
that you could get a basic UI automatically for domain models - not just 
for basic datatypes that Vaadin supports by default.

Fields can be used separately or via the SmartFieldFactory. If you
dare to mix some UI related annotations to you domain classes you can
add hints about the desired UI (like property order or desired field
implementation) for fields and the factory with "@SmartField" annotation. 


TODO

 * re-think configuration
 	* annotations cannot be only option for any configuration
 	* remove maps and just guide to extending the default implementation?
 	* Should there be classloader wide default factory type or instance?
 	  This would allow to configure once at app init - then used automatically.
 	* Form implementation: autoconfigured field order and SMF. 
 	* Co-operation with FormBinder?
 * lots of other commonly needed field types
 	* IntegerField
 	* DoubleField
 	* ...
 * Usability improvements
   * keyboard shortcuts
   * focusing
   * actually thinking out UI for various field impls.
 * i18n
 * Improve MapField
 	* editable key
 	* key uniqueness validation
 * (Write) Buffering support, this makes implementations much more complicated
